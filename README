Welcome to Linux-on-ECO32!

This little project offers the possibility to run Linux on the
ECO32 system, which is a system-on-chip, written in synthesizable
Verilog, together with a simulator, so that one can experiment
without the need to have an FPGA board available.

NOTE 1: It is absolutely necessary to first download and build
the ECO32 project, which is available on the OpenCores platform:

        http://opencores.org/project,eco32

NOTE 2: The Linux system (kernel as well as userland programs)
is only used by this project. The system has been ported, built
and tested by Stefan Kristiansson in his project

        http://github.com/skristiansson/eco32-linux

If you have any questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project), don't hesitate to contact the ECO32 team by email to

        Hellwig.Geisse@mni.thm.de

Enjoy!
