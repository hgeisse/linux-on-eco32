Welcome to Linux-on-ECO32!

This little project offers the possibility to run Linux on the
ECO32 system, which is a system-on-chip (written in synthesizable
Verilog), together with a simulator, so that one can experiment
without the need to have an FPGA board available. Linux is placed
onto a disk partition of a simulated disk and can be bootstrapped
from there.

NOTE 1: The Linux system itself (kernel and userland programs) is
merely used by this project. The system has been ported, built and
tested by Stefan Kristiansson in his project

        http://github.com/skristiansson/eco32-linux

NOTE 2: It is absolutely necessary to first download and build
the ECO32 project, which is available on the OpenCores platform:

        http://opencores.org/project,eco32

NOTE 3: In order to utilize the various tools from the ECO32
project, you will be asked to supply a path to the "build"
directory of the ECO32 project. The path depends on your local
installation, but usually ends in .../eco32/trunk/build.

If you have any questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project), don't hesitate to contact the ECO32 team by email to

        Hellwig.Geisse@mni.thm.de

Enjoy!
